# 📱 Habit Tracker Application #

## 🧠 Project Overview

Brief Description:

We are developing a Habit Tracker application to help users monitor and maintain their daily habits. The app is designed to assist individuals in building positive habits and staying consistent through reminders, progress tracking, and analytics.

What’s the goal?

The main goal of the application is to support users in forming new healthy habits or breaking bad ones by providing a simple and organized tool to record habits and track daily progress.

What problem does it solve?

Many people struggle to stick to new habits or keep track of their progress. This app solves that problem by offering an easy-to-use, visual solution that motivates users to stay consistent and accountable.

How does it work in general?

Users can add the habits they want to track (e.g., reading, exercising, drinking water). Each day, they log whether they completed the habit. The app displays weekly and monthly progress reports and uses notifications and reminders to keep users engaged and on track.
